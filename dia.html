<h3>Dia de Los Muertos or Day of the Dead is a very important day to many Latin cultures. On this day, people celebrate loved ones who have passed away.</h3>
<p> To celebrate, people create altars in their homes or on the graves of their loved ones. They leave flowers, food, photos, and incense to welcome the dead. People also wear and include skulls in most things on this day. They also dance and sing to honor the dead.</p>
